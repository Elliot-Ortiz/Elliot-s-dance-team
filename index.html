<h1> Elliot Ortiz </h1>
</header>
<h2> Everything you need to know </h2>
<p> Having a rough childhood, I was forced to learn things on my own, which turned me to be very adaptable to certain situations now. <P>

<h2> Who is Elliot Ortiz? </h2>
<p> I am a scholar activist that cares less about their grade and more about helping people in need. I will always care about others more than myself and I now find that as one of my best attributes because not many people would care about others for the happiness that they can bring, but rather for their own benefit. One of the biggest reasons why I dance is to make other people happy because happiness is the key to living a better lifestyle and everyone should be able to experience that.  <p>

<li> I enjoy walks in the park <li> lending help to people in need <li> having quality time with people<li> listening to old music and watching old movies<li> I absolutely love everything marvel and dc and can talk about it all day<li> I am not a normal guy, I am Elliot Ortiz</li>

<h2> Contact info </h2>

<p> You can contact me through my email or phone number <p>
<li><mark>School email:Elliot.ortiz@bsswa.org<li>phone number: 347-575-1395</li>


<h2> Letter to my future self </h2>
<p>Elliot you'll never be considered normal and that's a good thing, never try to "fit" in because your mom told you that you would always be destined for amazing things. You don't...and never have to be cool because you can't push away who you are; a nerdy, geeky kid who wishes he was spiderman. That kid inside of you will never leave you, that kid inside of you grounds you and gives you integrity to remember who you are. No matter the mistakes you make, no matter the amount of pain you experience or people you lose, you know who you are and what you need, which is yourself. Remember your purpose is happiness and it's always achievable. </p>
